# dotfiles

Here, you can find my dot files I use everyday on my Linux machine.

## Content
* binaries: essentially scripts
* home: dotfiles in home directory
* config: configuration files in .config directory

## Install
* Run `./setup.sh`.
* Edit `$HOME/.gitconfig_local` (useful for hiding email address):
    ```ini
    [user]
        email = secret@super-hidden.org
    ```
* You can also add a `$HOME/.bashrc_local` with specific commands.
